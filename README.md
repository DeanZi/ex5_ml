### Speech Command Classification using PyTorch with CNN

This is a PyTorch implementation of speech command classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
The model used in this implementation is based on the VGG architecture.

### Requirements
* PyTorch
* NumPy

### Dataset
The Google Speech Commands Dataset was used to train and evaluate the model. 
The dataset consists of 30 short (1 second) audio clips, each of which corresponds to a different word.

### Usage and Results
See `ex5_report.pdf`

### Author
This code was written by *DeanZi* as part of a university programming project. Feel free to use and modify it as you like.
